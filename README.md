The project is to implement a simple operating system (based on the Pintos system from Stanford University). The project has four stages:

    1. threads and synchronization,
    
    2. user programs,
    
    3. virtual memory, and
    
    4. filing services.
    
NOTE: This code is currently incomplete and fairly messy. Part 4, filing services, is currently being worked on.
